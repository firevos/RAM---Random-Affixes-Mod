TODO:
check quality range for items (make sure its normalized to 1-6 for mods that increase it)
make a nice looking spreadsheet to show all affixes for weapons and armor, and reworked armor set bonus
Fix affixes controller to show them separate from cosmetic slots
check gameevents.xml for ideas for effects
extraction instead of adding them to loot. using a similar system to reroll, make em pay something (also reroll token?) to extract and permanently remove an affix from an item to be able to install it as a regular mod in another item.

allow a way to 'choose' reroll for higher price
slow down the reroll a little, so you cant reroll instantly (accidently skipping good ones)
check Guns and Mods Reborn for incompatabilities
Challenges for reroll/upgrade tokens.

Fixed few localizations
changed certain filenames to match naming conventions for server sided mods
added a harmony check, you get a big error message when harmony is missing when using the mod

New Affixes:
Infection resist
more advanced: Spawn friendly bees that attack zombies

Reroll system for affixes:          DONE
    use the take(w) button on mods to reroll affix (use the canRemove prefix function). revert all mods back to being attachments rather than mods (so the button works)    DONE
    add it to a separate button instead         DONE
    consumes an item upon reroll (reroll token) DONE
    these tokens can be earned/looted/crafted/bought (if crafted, at least cost a diamond.) DONE
        -   recipe          DONE 
        -   looted          DONE
        -   bought          DONE
        -   quest reward    DONE
        -   quest completion DONE
    fully random rerolls (force change (e.g. can't reroll into the same one))   DONE
    show consumed item in bottomrighthud (check how its done in repair)     DONE
    play sound upon succesfull reroll   DONE
    update UI after a reroll - probably a refreshbindings on the right ui window    DONE
